# Splunk Version Control Cloud

## What does this app do?

This application is the simplified version of the Splunk Version Control application (VersionControl For Splunk on SplunkBase)

This application provides the dashboards, saved searches, macros and lookups required to allow a remote backup from the Splunk Version Control application

## Why?
The full application contains python code that would not work within the SplunkCloud environment, this simplified version contains no python code or custom commands

## How do I use this application? 

The dashboard within the application is only useful when the Splunk Version Control application is up and running remotely to create backups and trigger restores, please refer to the SplunkBase and github links below
